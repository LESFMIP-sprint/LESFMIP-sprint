# About 

As part of the [CANARI project](https://canari.ac.uk/) (Climate change in the Arctic â€“ North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run, [CANARI-LE](https://canari.ac.uk/resources_new/tools/).  Following the success of the data analysis sprint in March 2024 a data has been set for a second sprint, the week of January 27-31, 2025.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble, information about the [data and how to access it](data.md), [pre-event requirements](setup.md), [sprint](sprint.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).  Highlights from the previous can current sprints can be found on the [highlights](highlights.md) page. 

The analysis sprint will take place on JASMIN and be structured as follows: each day of the sprint (Mon-Thurs), there will be two discussion sessions on Zoom at 12pm UTC and 22pm UTC, respectively. These are intended for discussing aims, preliminary sharing of highlight results produced during the sprint, discussing data issues, etc. Attendees will also be encouraged to share figures, discussion items on Slack (TBC, or similar platform), which will be used for informal communication during the sprint.
 
Each day of the sprint, attendees are encouraged to spend ~half a day on analysis of LESFMIP (within their time-zones/ working days) and attend the highlight sessions where possible to foster active discussion and collaboration. The time slots have been chosen with different time-zones in mind, and we hope at least one of these will be suitable for all time-zones. 
 
More details will follow soon. Please add your name here to indicate your participation in the sprint, and ask your activity co-leads for information on requesting a JASMIN account. More details on JASMIN accounts, data access on JASMIN and availability is also available via the shared links.
